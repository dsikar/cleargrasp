Install on t2.small - not enough memory
Install on t2.medium - fail on demo (Segmentation fault)
Failing on python 3.5 and 3.6
Added notes on requirements_v2.txt and dependencies.txt to get 
code to run.

2020.10.1

Install on g3s.xlarge AWS EC2 GPU instance

Python 3.6

Error when updating requirements:
TypeError: getresponse() got an unexpected keyword argument 'buffering'
This post suggests there is a python2.7 script running somewhere:
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/68

Updated pip to version 20.x, reran and got error:
OpenEXR.cpp:1:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory

TODO - rerun with python 3.5
sudo apt-get --purge autoremove python3-pip

2020.10.04

Stopped and restarted EC2 instance. Noticed python 2.7 install.

Changed python symlink to point to version 3.5.

Installed requirements_v2.txt ok but still getting segmentation error when
running quick demo.

Removed pip, install with python3.6, added python.35 developer tools and ran again.

sudo apt-get install python3.6-dev

This time we get error:

ImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.27' not found (required by /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/open3d/open3d_pybind.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so)

Suggesting we need Ubuntu 18.04. 

** Installed on Ubuntu 18.04, with python3.6 default version. Got error when
installing requirements.txt:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'skbuild'

Installed skbuild using pip3. More errors, installed CUDA 9.x:

sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

Reran pip3 install -r requirements.txt, still getting segmentation fault error.
Assuming error was being thrown all along. Retrying with more RAM.

Manage to install open3d with sudo -H pip3 install open3d, proceeding.

Ran ok. Had to tweak depth example .sh because python2.7 was installed.
Once python3 was added to script, all good. Imath error due to python version.
